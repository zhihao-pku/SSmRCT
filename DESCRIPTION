Title: Regional sample size allocation for mRCT
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zhihao Cheng
Maintainer: Zhihao Cheng <zhihao.cheng@qilu-pharma.com>
Description: Using Japan's Method 1 and Method 2, this package is designed to determine regional sample size allocation strategies based on the marginal, conditional, and joint probabilities of global success, as well as the illustration of efficacy consistency between the target region and globally. It supports a variety of endpoints in superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence clinical trials, including continuous, binary, survival, and counts endpoints, and simultaneously supports both theoretical calculations and data simulations.
